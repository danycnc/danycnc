### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about the IT / ICT world, since adolescence I approached this world with great curiosity and desire to learn. I like to go to the bottom and understand as much as possible every aspect of the things I learn by going "behind the scenes", for this reason I use Linux as my default OS. Particular passion for programming and networking.

After a two-year experience in the TLC field thanks to a Cisco CCNA certification, I decided to broaden my knowledge in the IT field by attending various courses on Udemy.

Now I moved my focus to the Web, combining programming and networking, starting to attend a Full Stack Developer course at <a href="http://www.develhope.co">Develhope</a>
